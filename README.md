### Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub ProfileðŸ‘‹

### About me and my journey to becoming a software engineer :smile:

- Prior to taking on a new venture to become a software developer with Nologyâ€™s brilliant full stack course, I  was  acquiring my doctorate in the field of materials science and engineering.   

- Since my PhD was industrially driven, I had a unique learning opportunity  working  with various stakeholders within the steel sector, finding solutions to optimise their products and processes.  

- My passion for technology lies in the solutions that it provides for industries I worked in ( both engineering and clinical trials sector) and an eagerness to develop future proof skills in tech: A continously evolving field.  

- I enjoy learning and beleive my journery with tech will keep me ethused. :heart:
